# Computer-Networks-Assignments-
-various coding assignments for computer networks lectures- 
<br /> first asignment is a comparison of the bit error rate of sending an encoded message or without coding through a noisy channel
<br /> the encoding is done using reed solomon encoding 

<br />the following is the comparison plot between the performance of the encoded message vs uncoded message   
<br />

<br /> the second encoding is done using repetition encoding 

<br />the following is the comparison plot between the performance of the encoded message vs uncoded message
